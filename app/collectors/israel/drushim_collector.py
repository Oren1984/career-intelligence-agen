# app/collectors/israel/drushim_collector.py
# This file defines the DrushimCollector class for scraping jobs from Drushim.co.il, Israel

"""
Drushim.co.il collector — Israel's largest mainstream job board.

STATUS: ENABLED (mock-safe)
Real scraping: NOT YET IMPLEMENTED — see TODOs below.

Drushim does not provide a public API. Real implementation requires
HTTP scraping of search results pages with BeautifulSoup or Playwright.

Mock behavior: returns hardcoded sample jobs for development/testing.
