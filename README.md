## 🧠 Career Intelligence Agent — Local RAG Edition

A privacy-first Career Intelligence Agent that helps evaluate job opportunities, analyze role fit, identify skill gaps, and recommend the most relevant portfolio projects using local data and evidence-based retrieval.

This project is a **decision-support system**, not an automation tool.

It is designed to help make better career decisions while keeping the user fully in control.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

The **Career Intelligence Agent** is a local AI-powered career analysis system built around personal career data, job descriptions, scoring logic, portfolio matching, and local RAG-based evidence retrieval.

The system analyzes job opportunities against a structured candidate profile, identifies strengths and gaps, recommends whether a role is worth pursuing, and suggests which portfolio projects best support the application.

Unlike automated job-application systems, this project does not apply to jobs automatically.

It helps the user think, compare, and decide based on structured analysis and evidence from their own documents.

## 🧱 Architecture & System Design

The system is designed as a local decision-support platform with clear separation between configuration, data, retrieval, scoring logic, dashboard UI, tests, and documentation.

```

The system keeps career documents, retrieval, scoring, dashboard logic, and configuration separated so the project remains understandable, maintainable, and easy to extend.

## 🧠 How Local RAG Works

The local RAG workflow is based on private career documents stored on the user's machine.

Career documents
        ↓
knowledge_base/
        ↓
Local indexing with TF-IDF
        ↓
Relevant evidence retrieval
        ↓
Job analysis and career insight generation

The system works as follows:

Career documents are placed inside knowledge_base/
The system indexes them locally using TF-IDF
When a job description is analyzed, relevant evidence is retrieved
The output is grounded in the user's own data
Nothing needs to leave the local machine for the core workflow

---

## 🔀 Execution Modes

The system supports three explicit execution modes from the dashboard sidebar.

ModeWhat RunsWhen to Use
Hybrid (RAG + Agent)Career scoring + knowledge base retrievalDefault mode for full analysis with evidence
Agent OnlyCareer scoring only, without knowledge retrievalWhen the knowledge base is not indexed or only scoring is needed
RAG OnlyKnowledge base retrieval only, without scoringWhen the user only wants to inspect available evidence

Each mode is shown clearly in the UI.

The dashboard displays:

- Active execution mode
- Mode description
- Execution status
- Components used during the run
- Success or failure state

Example:

Mode: Hybrid (RAG + Agent) | Status: Success | Components: Career Scorer + KB Retrieval
Mode Behavior
Hybrid — full analysis with career scoring and knowledge base evidence
Agent Only — scoring and recommendation without RAG evidence
RAG Only — evidence retrieval only, without scoring

The "Should I Apply?" and "Which Project?" actions require the scoring engine.
If RAG Only is selected, the UI prompts the user to switch to a scoring-enabled mode.

---

## 🧮 Scoring System

The scoring system evaluates job fit across multiple dimensions.

- DimensionWeight
- Skill Overlap25%
- Title Relevance20%
- Seniority15%
- Domain Fit15%
- Work Mode10%
- Strategy Fit10%
- Portfolio Match5%

The result is translated into a practical recommendation label:

- Apply
- Stretch
- Skip

The project does not require paid APIs for core functionality.

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes
This system is not an automatic job application bot.
It does not apply to jobs on behalf of the user.
The user stays fully in control of all career decisions.
Core functionality is local and privacy-first.
The system is designed for analysis, prioritization, and decision support.

---

## 🏁 Final Note

This project is part of my AI Engineering portfolio.

It represents a practical local AI decision-support system that combines career data, scoring logic, local RAG retrieval, Streamlit UI, and structured documentation.

The goal is not to automate career decisions, but to help make better decisions using evidence, structure, and clear analysis.
